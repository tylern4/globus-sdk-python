    client-side and therefore cannot keep secrets. Unable to possess client
    credentials, several Globus Auth interactions have to be specialized to
    accommodate the absence of a secret.

            space-separated string or iterable of strings. Defaults to

            thereby be passed back to the ``GlobusNativeAppFlowManager``)

            custom page. It defaults to the string '_default'
